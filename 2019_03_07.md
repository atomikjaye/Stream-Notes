## What did you stream: Made promise work, worked on pub sub for sub wall

## Things I learned

#### [@joshmanders](http://www.twitch.tv/joshmanders)  - HELPED ME WITH EVERYTHING!!! 
- I learned about array mapping and a bit about event loops
- - [@joshmanders](http://www.twitch.tv/joshmanders) - "Imagine you (the for loop) have a bucket of water balloons(promises), you throw them in the air, and rely on gravity (event loop) to bring them down (which would be the promises being resolved).
- In order to use Twitch's pub sub, you need to have an Oauth Token that has a scope attached to it, in our case. The Link we used was: https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=[YOUR CLIENT_ID HERE]&redirect_uri=[YOUR REDIRECT URL HERE]&scope=[ENTER SCOPE HERE]


## Stream Ideas
- [@mymultiextruder](http://www.twitch.tv/mymultiextruder) - We should have fail counters!
- [@joshmanders](http://www.twitch.tv/joshmanders) - add stream videos to stream notes.
- Record timing from when I say goodbye to actually sign off. Some type of command.
