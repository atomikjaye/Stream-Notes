### Things I learned
- Make sure grid-template-areas has the same amount of rows and columns you've declared, or else it will error out.
- Nodelists and Arrays are different things @modayilme

### Next Steps
 - Read Books @MrFartBrains sent you!

- Put Add Event Listeners on Document, and judge action by target's inner HTML @Jawaka23

``` javascript
// "if you're having issues with the buttons not working, instead of using an event listener for each button, try using one click event listener on the document object"

docuent.addEventListener("click", callbackhere);
// then inside your callback do 
(event.target === whateverButton) { do stuff for the button }
 
 ```
