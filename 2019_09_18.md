## What did you stream: Node/Express Db for Secondlife 

### Things I learned
- SSH is default port 22
- You can make your local host public via localtunnel [MarsRaptor](http://www.twitch.tv/marsraptor)
- When you install something globally through terminal, said installation is not installed to your project. Must install to package.json as well. [MarsRaptor](http://www.twitch.tv/marsraptor)
