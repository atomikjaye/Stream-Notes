## What did you stream: LSL Scripting for Secondlife

## Recap
- Did 15min freecodecamp challenge, got to 22 (You need to brush up on forms Jaye!).
- We "fixed" detached HUD script problem (aka we did nothing and it worked).
- We added coin functionality.
- We worked on updating the player to the database every time coin has been clicked.

### Things I learned
- In llRegionSayTo, you need to pass NULL_KEY for the filter instead of OwnerID because you were actually waiting for messages sent by owner and not by the coin. [@ElectricHavoc](http://www.twitch.tv/ElectricHavoc)

### Next Steps
- Find out how to make the coin only able to be touched once by player.
- Delete Milouroux's points for testing.
- Figure out how to discourage cheating.
- Think alternate cases and junks.
