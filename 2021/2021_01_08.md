Programming(ish) and Graphic design.

## Recap

- I wanted to add Chat Credits by [Instafluff](http://www.instafluff.tv) to our stream notes, but unfortunately, I figured out I had to restart my computer. Figured I'd save that for later so we just worked on my Stream Panels!

### Next Steps

- Restart computer and get ChatCredits to work
- Add Stream Panels to twitch
- Design website so we can code it soon
