## What did you stream

 I used Illustrator and Figma to design my profile(?) page. Still deciding how this page is going to function.

### Things I learned

- I learned about Venezuelan Poodle Moths and Rosy Maple Moths from [@SquibbleDesign](http://www.twitch.tv/SquibbleDesign)!
- I learned T-Pain has stream music! from [@stomptheyarn](http://www.twitch.tv/stomptheyarn)! View them here: [PizzlePack](https://pizzlepack.com/) (Can I use this on youtube?)
- My online frands are way too kind ðŸ˜­ðŸ’•ðŸ’–
