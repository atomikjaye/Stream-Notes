## What did you stream: Vue JS

## Recap
We started off with some bugs, but we fixed them! They were pretty simple looking back. I got a large part of the project done. I was following this tutorial: [Learn Vue.js - Full Course for Beginners](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc&t=3970s). Overall, I'm happy that I've gotten so far. Now I just need to understand why certain things work! ðŸ˜…

### Things I learned
- Do not use href with bootstrap vue, as it fires one of their own functions for links... "NO HREFS ON A BUTTON EVER" - [@mmosholder](http://www.twitch.tv/mmosholder)



### Next Steps
- Finish Vue.js tutorial
- Adapt it to dev breakfast

### Links/ Look into Stuff
- Make code pretty and learn ESLint [ESLint + Prettier + VS Code â€” The Perfect Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHAeK8t94as) suggested by [@toelint2](http://www.twitch.tv/toelint2)

- [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org) - [@mmosholder](http://www.twitch.tv/mmosholder)

- [The Secrets They Keep](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-They-Keep-Guardians-Society-ebook/dp/B07PBXP24D/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=The+Secrets+they+keep&qid=1553816334&s=gateway&sr=8-2) - a new book by [@toelint2](http://www.twitch.tv/toelint2) wife!
