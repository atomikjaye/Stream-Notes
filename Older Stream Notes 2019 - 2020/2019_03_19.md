## Recap

Stream was amazing! I got basic functionality working. However, we can't use decimals if our previousNum is a decimal because the .includes function is tied to whatever is in the display, and since we already have a decimal, it won't let us click it. Also, calculator's calculation should be added to the display if previous key clicked was an operation key (multiple operation clicks) is clicked regardless if the equal key was clicked... Did that even make sense? whatever. lol. Also after equal key is clicked, when you click another number key, the number is appended to the display.

### Things I learned

-   [.includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes) is a thing
-   "Progress not Perfection" @modayilme
-   "[Sioux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux)" is pronounced "Sue" and are groups of Native American Tribes and First Nations peoples in North America

### Next Steps

-   Figure out how to automatically include twitch links for usernames
-   Fix calculator decimal situation
-   When you click addition the second time, you want the current sum to be displayed regardless if the "equal" button was pressed.
-   After sum if added, if you click another number, it gets added to the display... should not happen.
-   Add Keyboard functionality
