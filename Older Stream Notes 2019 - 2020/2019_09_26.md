## What did you stream: Secondlife LSL


## Goals
- Make coins touchable once
- Figure out ways to prevent cheating
- Set up Heroku site

## Recap
We added new coins, was about to make coins clickable once

Tried to prevent cheating via postman, but it does not create new player.

### Things I learned
- Secondlife lets you edit scripts externally [@ElectricHavoc](http://www.twitch.tv/ElectricHavoc)


## Stream Ideas
- Make an applause sound clip.

### Next Steps
- Have a tester to test scripts
- Work on styling HUD
- Set up heroku? (is it too early?)
- How to keep list if coin is "reset" maybe use notecard? and have notecard erased?
